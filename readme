# FMS-FSDI

Code relaese for [Fusing Multi-Scale Frequency and Spatial Domain Information for Few-Shot Fine-Grained Image Classification]

## Code environment

* You can create a conda environment with the correct dependencies using the following command lines:

  ```shell
  conda env create -f environment.yml
  conda activate FMSFSDI
  ```

## Dataset
You can download CUB_200_2011, cars, dogs, iNaturalist2017, and mini-ImageNet using following URL.
- CUB_200_2011 \[[Download Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WxDB3g3U_SrF2sv-DmFYl8LS0p_wAowh/view)\]
- cars \[[Download Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ImEPQH5gHpSE_Mlq8bRvxxcUXOwdHIeF/view?usp=drive_link)\]
- dogs \[[Download Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13avzK22oatJmtuyK0LlShWli00NsF6N0/view?usp=drive_link)\]
- iNaturalist2017 \[[Dataset Page](https://github.com/visipedia/inat_comp/tree/master/2017), [Download Data](https://ml-inat-competition-datasets.s3.amazonaws.com/2017/train_val_images.tar.gz), [Download Annotations](https://ml-inat-competition-datasets.s3.amazonaws.com/2017/train_2017_bboxes.zip)\]
- mini-ImageNet \[[Dataset Page](https://github.com/twitter/meta-learning-lstm), [Download Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3Irx3uQNoBMQ1FlNXJsZUdYWEE/view)\]

The preprocessing of these datasets is the same as [FRN](https://github.com/Tsingularity/FRN), but the categories  of train, val,
and test follows /datasetsplit/cub.txt, /datasetsplit/car.txt, /datasetsplit/dog.txt, and /datasetsplit/cross_domain.txt.

Under each folder, images are organized into train, val, and test. In addition, you may also find folders named val_pre and test_pre, which contain validation and testing
images pre-sized to 84x84 for the sake of speed.

## Train

* To train FMS-FSDI on `CUB_fewshot_raw` with Conv-4 backbone under the 1/5-shot setting, run the following command lines:

  ```shell
  cd experiments/CUB_fewshot_raw/Conv-4
  ./train.sh
  ```

* For ResNet-12 backbone, run the following command lines:

  ```shell
  cd experiments/CUB_fewshot_raw/ResNet-12
  ./train.sh
  ```

## Test

```shell
    cd experiments/CUB_fewshot_raw/Conv-4
    python ./test.py

    cd experiments/CUB_fewshot_raw/ResNet-12
    python ./test.py
```
